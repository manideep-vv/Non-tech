under estimate- under staffing, staff burnout, no plan  for proper tesing
over estimation-  high price quotation,longer than neccesary time to deliver, others will win the price bid competiotion

Note:
FP - The size of a software is measured in function points

Terminologies
1) cocomo- constructive cost model

while estimating consider below:-
0) best way is always decompose the project into granular part and then estimate and sumup
or take expert experience and estimate based on previous project experience
1) always check what is in scope, what is out of scope, understand project boundaries
2) project specific charecterstics ()
3) Common factors
4) static factors
5) consider all the impacts, Risks and blockers before giving final estimation
6) instead of giving estimation for entire project at once, give estiamtion phase/module wise

two kinds of estimation technique are
parametric (1) productivity based, 2)COCOMO)
Hueristic

1) Effort estimation through pre baselined productivity or based on past data
2) effort estimation through constructive cost model

Estimation techniques
1)PERT - program evaluation review technique
2) Critical path method- 
3) cocomo- constructive cost model- the max and minumum schedule in months of the project is derived 
on the basis of cocomo formula 

size estimation techniques are 
1) Function point - it is a method to represent the size of a software system
2) Feature point
3) TEchnical components
4) Use case point
5) line of code


IFPUG FPA is the recommended method for estimating the size of greenfield development project in tcs
IFPUG-->(Internations Function point user group)1984- this grp maintains the standards
========================================================================================
Function point like story points are used to measure the size of a software app

Functional point is a unit of measure for functional size
more functional points means the application is functionally big
To tell how big the story 
like to measure distance we use kilometres/miles,
weight is measured in kgs,
water is measured in litres
The size of a software is measured in functional points ex:- if it is big it has 100s of functional points, 50 for small project

its is a method of representing the size of a software, interms of functionality it delivers to the user
it is language independent
That system should be decomposed into many individual parts/functional unit

More function points means more cost, more effort is required to build the software

While measuring software size using function points consider all below
1) first make it into granular small functionality & then estimate
2) consider requirement diagrams,Data flow diagrams, data models, flow charts, screen layouts,
Entity relationships, interface descriptions, reports, no of screens

lets say once estimated, if customer added anything out of scope, 
based on the size of business functionality, calculate the number of functional points 

5 functional units to calculate the functional points are 
1) ILF-internal log files 2) ELF - external logical files 3) Ext input 4) Ext o/p 5) ext enquiry
========================================
Data function is the small functionality that satisfies the user requirements
here logical files are nothing but databases/data stored in files
1) Internal logical file - maintained by the application 
2) external interface logical file - maintained outside of app boundary

2 parameters are required to determine the complexity of data functions
1) DET --> Data element type 2) RET--> record element type
The attributes of a table or a file are counted as DET

The subgroup of data within the table or a file which can not exists independently are called RET

Transaction functions
--------------------
TF are the functionalities that satisfy the functional user requirements
TF includes external inquiries

Elementary process
it is the smallest unit of activity that is meaningful to the user
3 types - external input, ext output, ext query
ex:- add employee

3) External input- data comes into the system
4) Ext output- data goes out of the system
5) Ext enquired- combination of i/o - resulting data retrival

FTR- file type referenced is ILF internal logical file or extenal logical file\
VAF= (TDI*0.01)+0.65
