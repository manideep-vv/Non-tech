speak what they need



in ppt
-------
outline key points, explain then & finally summarize
keep more white space and clean look, dont included lot of lines ,coloured and patterned background 
avoid complete sentences, avoid words in caps
use big font size, use contrasting colours
1) use short crisp points,
2) instead of dense paragraph use bulleted points, less punctuation
3) mostly use white coloured background , 2 coloured scheme for text , better readability
4) use 6-6-6 formula , 6 words per points, 6-points per slide , 6- consecutive text only per slide
5) place holder consistency- maintain consistency in placeholders for slides,text,headers, footers, dont change placeholder sfrom center to left or right
6) use proper charts like pie charts
7) avoid bias in graphics, use both genders

audience
------------
involve audience- talk only 80% of the time, use rest of the time to involve others to speak and make more interactive
2) know about audience how good they are
3) catch the pulse/needs,interests, concerns of audience and understand what they are looking for
4) know the knowledge level of audience
5) u should anticipate what people are expecting from you and speak in such order,if u dont know 
then ask them what are they expecting from u

Do speak bit slowly

Dont present if u didnt prepare
dont ignore audience include QA sessions
dont add irrelevant graphics
dont share too much information in less time span
