1) while influencing, we should ask questions- like how lalitha jewellery guy ask, ex- what are the some of the benefits u are getting in lalitha jewellery
while influencing instead of just telling them what they have to do u have to ask them questions
what are the advantages, benefits... with lalitha
2)consensus- we are influenced by what many similar other are doing
u should tell like - here is why other people buying this
3) authority- we look to experts for guidance

4) scarcity- we find things more attractive to the degree that they are scarce, rare- tell like what u chance to loose by not taking it

5) Tell them what are they going to loose
=====================================
reality is people get attracted not because of benefits
they will be attracted when we tell what they are going to loose
ask like- what are the some of disadvantages, how this will negatively impact u -- these kind of questions will draw peoples attention


ex:- when govt asked them to take vaccine no body is inclined,
but when media reported there is a shortage immediately every one started taking it

6) liking- we prefer to say yes to those we know and like
so comment on similarity- i am also from same state and same city
we like those people who likes us adn tell them we should like u
look for those areas where u can honestly praise other people too
