always think why, what, how - enduku , emiti, ela
we should embrace/welcome the risk
when the disaster strikes ur business can  it survive?? 
when ur entire team on leave how do u manage?????



in real life also - always identify the risk
ex:- if u are doing any task, assess what is the risk,
if i miss this chance what is the risk, if i miss applying H1 what is the risk
if i dont learn now, what is the risk/impact???

always question stakeholders/sponsors and keep asking what they want
causes of risk/when projects becomes risky??
-------
1) no awareness of what is happenning  inside  the projects
2) have a plan B
3) to understand the complexity decouple the system and ask status about that
4) requirements volatility/changes

calculate the risk
=================
1) calculate the severity of risk based on the impact and probability of re-occurance 
and check whether u can tolerate it or not--> zero tolerance , ex:- attending late to olympics race, or attending my own marriage here we are zero tolerance
2) as a project manager, we always take the risks, but make sure it is calculated

RISK identification
----------------------
1) talk to stake holders, front line staff, 
2) conduct a risk identification workshop, and review all the risks with senior management 
ex:- if key team member leaves like if sriram leaves....
3) identify its is a small risk or not,means task level risk or project level risk
3) identify the risk triggers, ex:- if excess smoke is coming from cars,it indicates something went wrong, ,

lly if excess bugs are coming then it is a risk trigger, it indicates something wrong is happenning in the project, reviews might not be happenning properly..or something big bug is coming in production
4) maintaining risk register is useful

reducing the risks /(addressing a threat)
=============
1) avoid- means reduce the scope of project
2) Escalate:- 
3) Transfer- outsourcing the scope /little work based on our capabilities
4) mitigate- reducing the risk, if u cant mitigate the risk , atleast analyze why the risk happened,
we cant mitigate  all the risks, but we can prioritise
5) Accept - means accepting the risk, if it is of impact and rarely occuring, then accept the risk & 
6) 1st document all the major risks in the project
7) put contigenct resources


note:- focus on risk triggers,ex:- if 
if u are continuosly getting requirements, 

lly there are some risk triggers
