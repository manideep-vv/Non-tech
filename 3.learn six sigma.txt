Note:- decisions must be data driven
we should always be proactive instead of reactive
1) ASk why for 5 times why if needed, ask why then u will get answer,then based on that answer, ask another Y
2) always while doing a project, define the controls in excel sheet mention what & when to monitor 
all the Critical To quality CTQ requirements should be included as part of controls (control subject) , 


while doing project as part of six sigma analysis do below
1) draw a value stream map- understand the flows from supplier to customer and check each process box is there any chance of defect and rework possibilities?


Six Sigma is a set of methodologies and tools used to improve business processes by reducing defects and errors, minimizing variation, and increasing quality and efficiency

Terminologies:
1) waste is anything that is of no value to cusotmers
2) Lean is all about --> eliminating waste and maximizing value to customers
   To be lean means provide what is needed when it is needed, with minimum amount of materials
equipment, labour,space, 
3) project charter: what we need is called project charter, it is a document that provide 
direction and focus to project team
it tells the purpose, goal ,scope of the project
4) SIPOC -supplier, input,process, output, customer
why? to understand high level view of process
5) takt rate--> customer demanded rate

Lean six sigma
=========
customer focus
effectiveness & efficient processes
proactive prevention and control


Project charter
==============
1)that doc should contain what we need,
2)it should display SMART goals- s-specific,M-Measurable,A-attainable,R-Relevant, T-Timebound
3) it should contain--> problem statement, goal statement,key metrics, financial benefits, project scope, what is out of scope, project boundaries, milestones, completion dates
(performance measure to be improved)
if u dont understand what is out of scope, then u will fell into project creep ,means unknwoingly increase of project scope



value: this is what cusotmers need, expect, and willing to pay for
Bottleneck or constraints:- slowest processing step of a value stream
six sigma strives for perfection, achieve efficiency & effective work


SIPOC
========
to understand high level view of process
SIPOC -supplier, input,process, output, customer
process:- take order, prepare pizza, bake pizza, box it, deliver to customer
Supplier- is any one who provides the inputs to the process ex:- flour mills,ingredient suppliers
input:- flour, masalas,
output: pizza
cusotmers- who is going to eat

VOC:- voice of customer/ Customer satisfaction survey
cusotmer is anyone who are utilizing our services

CTQ 
=====
are Critical to Quality requirements:- performance charecterstics that are critically important to customers

Cost of poor quality
===================
means the costs occurred due to poor performance
These things can be avoided if things were done right at first time

Demo:-
-----
demo using swim lane process map (using flow charts), these process maps contain small few major steps

Measure phase
================
1) determine what is critical to customers
2) develop a data collection plan for measuring 

process maps
1) high level process map (displays main activities inside a process)
2) swim lane 
3)Detailed
4)value stream

1) High level process maps
contains only major activities ex:- comunicating with fiserv, creating an react page,storing in sql server
like checkin, see doctor,checkout ,pay 
if u want to know more, then create detailed individual process maps

What is value:
Value is whatâ€™s important to customers


Values streams
----------------
 All end to end process activities, resources, information used to transform inputs to outputs that are salable to customers
 1) value stream map is a diagram that shows all the steps involved from supplier to customer
 2) value stream maps shows the materials and information flows
instead of this value streams map process diagram, we can happily use high level process map
This only have extra information like time for each process

Measurement system analysis (MSA)
------------
validate the measurement system with measurement system analysis
Make sure ur measurement system is validated first- like tool Jmeter it should be correct 
it should always gives consistent output
evaluates repeatability, reproducability
repeatability means- if same item is weighed more number of times, it should give consistent output
reproducability- other machines also should give same output
in real code:app should give speedy output in consistent mode

Descriptive analysis
======================
it states the statistics data of my performace , like high speed, low speed, avg 
MEasure of central tendency
1) prepare pareto charts--> a bar/graph chart, x -axis all issues, y-axis all occurance to see the which issue is  most frequenctly occurring 
ex:- dot plots,histograms, bar charts

DMAIC
----
AIC- Analyze phase, improve phase, control phase


Analyze (analyze the value stream maps)
1)analyse waste, delays, quality problems,and anything that doesnot generate any value to customers
2) Analyze value streams and process maps created during measure phase 
in value stream map understand each process major box  for high defect rates and rework rates evaluate its process metrics such as long processing times, low yeild, 
3) during anlysis phase, go through the design and analyse the potential problems 
4) use 5 why's principle, means ask why for 5 times if needed
6) create cause effect diagrams and then u can easily demo
7) u can analyze the performance of 2 companies using box plots, dot plots... grpahical analysis is easy

RTY- roll throughput yeild

cause effect diagram is simply a diagram to list the potential causes of particular effect
for still data u can use pareto charts for continous data use box plots, histograms, dot plots 
once this cause effect diagram is ready ask them to vote

improve phase (DMAIC)
======================================================
1) generate potential solutions
2) Evaluate solution alternatives
3) select best solutions and implement

LEan six sigma improve tools
1) Failure modes and effective analysis (FMEA)
2) Error proofing
3) 5S 
4) Just in time
5) kaizen (continuos improvement)
6) criteria selection and pugh matrices


FMEA
here analyse the process and identify the potential suspected failures, 
Document all the potential failures and their severities in a excel sheet and prioritize all the risks
2) error-proofing /mistake-proofing
prevention,facilitation,detection, 
its says detect and mitigate the errors immediately
3) 5S- sort, straighten or set in order,shine or sweep,standardize,sustain
These 5s describes how a work area should be
sort- remove un needed items- 
tag all items with coloured stick notes
like removing waste, waste is anything that is generating no value to customer,
 immediate tasks / items needed for current work are tagged with  green/ keep them in green stick notes, 
 weekly or montly are kept in yellow stick notes, yearly tasks are kept in red stick notes

Green tag items are placed in easy reach and use while working, keep red tag items in another place
 like basement

shine: uncluttered work area is cleaned or swept
standardize: create standard work procedures  like rolling silver paper, wiping desks
safety- the work area is audited for safety practices

Just in time:- says always pull(instead of push) or just in time flow
it is all about balancing the work load, identify which ODC/branch is delivering at less speed

Kaizen :- says continuos improvement it is a rapid improvement event

kaizen is a well organized facilitaed event to improve a work area/department/process
or entire value stream
ex:- like re-organizing the work station, Document the improved process with maps,
Develop sop(standard operating procedures)

criteria selection matrix:
-------------------------
after analysing the value stream map , after identifying the alternate solutions
u have to pick the best solution using this criteria selection matrix/pugh matrix

first prepare the evaluation criteria , ensure critieria should have
CTQ- critical to quality requirements
Impact?
cost?
and write the weightage to each solution, prepare a excel sheet and give marks to each solution
and finally choose a solution

pugh concept selection matrix
------------------------------
if u have many alternative solution and if u want to choose 1 best then u can follow this approach - this method is recommended when u already have a baseline & u are comparing against that

this is used when u are comparing alternate solution with a existing process,product,service
in this we wont give numbers, where are we will give only + or - or s for same with respect to baseline
we have to sum up all plus and minuses 

control
============================================================
establishing controls is all about what to monitor and when to monitor,after monitoring what action to take, Frequency of measurement
1) in the sheet mention that --> if actual is going very less than expected then what to do ??
ex:- bake the maida at 112F ,monitor every minute , if temp goes beyond then decrease temp manually


1) establish controls 2) monitor
1) create a plan to monitor, control and regulate performance
control plan says when to take action and what action to take
2)to incorporate controls work with process owners to update the standard work procedures
3)as per process control plan u have to prepare a sheet, stating what to watch and when to watch
ex:- u have to measure the project milestone % reach, & u mention like to watch every sprint
similarly in real life , we should also have a control sheet saying 
1) every week how much we are completing & how far away we are from our goal
2) we have to revisit/monitor this process every week...

Statistical process control
--------------------------
When something went wrong the purpose of SPC is to bring the situation to control

spc is to contrl the process by interving when to take action & when to leave process alone
the purpose of the spc is to identify the special causes and trouble shoot
The focus of spc is process variation

process variation is of 2 types 
Random, non-random
Random variation - is a chance or due to common causes
Non random variation- due to unforseen special causes that interfere with routine operation-  like broken tools, jammed equipment

intervien when the process is out of control

Value stream management
------------------------
1) 

SWOT analysis- means strength weakness opportunity threat analysis
