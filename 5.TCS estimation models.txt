Many estimation models are there
1) early estimation model
lets say once estimated, if customer added anything out of scope, 
based on the size of business functionality, calculate the number of functional points 

calculate
Phase wise effort breakup
Phase wise schedule breakup
Phase wise manpower loading

the measurement of size is prduction support point
Effort= person days
for support projects use defect prediction model
in prod support more than 100 person hours means use function points based model for enhancement
OBP- organizational baseline productivity
productivity of a production support based on KEDB, nu of interfaces, platform type
for monitoring we should consider it as a static factor

FEature-->epic-->user story
primary agile estimations are done at 3 levels
1) BID levels
2) PI levels
3) sprint levels

space- tcs story point based agile comprehensive estimation technique
SPACE is a tool in TCS , if u enter technology and some work it will automatically gives the story points for that sprint

give story points based on complexity 
in space we have to select parameters like technology and other resp values, GEnerate story points from space
