Many estimation models are there
1) early estimation model
lets say once estimated, if customer added anything out of scope, 
based on the size of business functionality, calculate the number of functional points 

calculate
Phase wise effort breakup
Phase wise schedule breakup
Phase wise manpower loading

the measurement of size is prduction support point
Effort= person days
for support projects use defect prediction model
in prod support more than 100 person hours means use function points based model for enhancement
OBP- organizational baseline productivity
productivity of a production support based on KEDB, nu of interfaces, platform type
for monitoring we should consider it as a static factor

FEature-->epic-->user story
primary agile estimations are done at 3 levels
1) BID levels
2) PI levels
3) sprint levels

space- tcs story point based agile comprehensive estimation technique
SPACE is a tool in TCS , if u enter technology and some work it will automatically gives the story points for that sprint

give story points based on complexity 
in space we have to select parameters like technology and other resp values, GEnerate story points from space


value proposition statement
--------------------
its a statement describes how ur prodcut ,solves customer problem,delivers some benefit and improves their situation

if u say enterprise level best in class--dont tell these and all
how it solves customer problem- speak in a language customer can understand- like it saves time,

 when u are bidding a project from tcs we should prepare value a word file named value proposition statement which will be provided to customers 
 by seeing that document only they will think buy our product.
 in that document "talk about why customer should buy our product only"
 
 or any company or while selling our products we should
 start with why
 when u are explaining tell 
 1) why only tcs ex:- apple while marketing it will talk about why only apple product because of security, so talk about why first
 2) How
 3) what is our product?
 but in mails u should write "what,why" ex:- what is corona, then why corona comes?
 Dont talk about like we have 150 branches ....bla bla 
 
 
 MSA- master service aggrement
 sow- statement of work
while signing a contract 
------------------------------
1) check all security requirements obligations, holding access to production db , sub contractors having prod db access
like we shouldnot share any personal data with any other third party
2) penalties
3) sub contractors involvment
4) Data retention policy (while signing tcs should store all proj infor for 2 years to get ready for audit) -MSA,SOW,CR,BGC reports,NDA reports
so when contract expires make sure to save the docs as per policy
5) customer consent is required for all third party/ licensed software that will be used as part of delivery 
(TCS should make customer responsible for procuring all such licenses)


ex:- Prod SLA which is signed by TCS to wells fargo client, those rules should flow down to the new 3rd party software which we are using
ex:2- vendors(TCS) are not responsible for loss or corruption of data which is maintained by 3rd party like AWS (here aws is 3rd party) this same clause should be told to cusotmer by tcs in MSA 
6) if u are using open source software we should get the written approval from them

if any of these are not followed then its called breach of customer aggrement only
 
sub contractors
-----------------------
1) if we are involving sub contractors we should get written approval from  customers
TCS is responsible for contractors performance
