pp3 helped me in being more assertive 
1) assertive means- talk calmly about an outcome and 
		ability to express your needs and feelings clearly and firmly without disrespecting or undermining others
2) control the anger in any situation- if ur car damaged by others instead of damagigng their car which is not going to help any one better ask the person for a fine 
3) pareto principle- 20% of work will generate 80% of value
4) when i am speaking with customers & stakeholders- i see some significant changes in my communication from what i was earlier with the help of course like - commence connect and articulation for impact
like- when u are expressing my dis agreement earlier i used to say no, but now i am improving my articulation - i am afraid that i have some doubts if i could be able to complete this or not
- daily tasks in sprint reviews about the possibility of completing that task
