pp3 helped me in being more assertive 
1) assertive means- talk calmly about an outcome and 
		ability to express your needs and feelings clearly and firmly without disrespecting or undermining others
2) control the anger in any situation- if ur car damaged by others instead of damagigng their car which is not going to help any one better ask the person for a fine
