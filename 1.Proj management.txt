terminologies
==============
stake holders- means owner or all the people who are all impacted by your work like
process ,product owners managers, others who are all impacted by the problem

project scheduling
======================================================================
1) while estimating if u cant estimate a total project then follow iterative approach
 breaking down the project into smaller tasks and estimate the time required for each task.

we should review the estimates with the people who know the work
u should think about risks also
know all the skills required
 
while fixing timeline, u have to consider the holidays, team strength
5-10% for co-ordination,communication,ewsolving mis understanding, reviews,bug fixes, un anticipated tasks

give trainings to others
Early start - atm max it can start by that earliest data
late start - by max it should start definitely by that time, it wont get delayed
early finish - at min it can complete by that and it cant be completed before that
late finish - by max it can extend till that date.

if someone cant finish that work - just re-assign that to some other resources who can do best& reduce over allocations
always consider persons who is going to offboard - resignations..

Managing a project means
======================
Managing 
scope
Time
cost
Resources
Quality- if u reduce quality both money and time will be wasted

1) always update & watch the schedule - to know where do we stand
Project never run on time, so always update the actual progress in sheet to
choose rights frequency to update the project
2) team members should tell the actual status in early time not at the end else project will go out of control and u will not have time to fix the issues-
-Early warnings are always better than late warnings

3) always choose least risky activities to fasten

Managing stakeholders
============================
understand the stakeholder requirements from requiremenents traceability matrix
if someone opposes or resistant then understand the reason behind it
always converse with stake holders to get the latest requirements

preventing project scope increasement
=================================
scope is all the work which is required to complete a project
product scope- features and funtions requested
project scope- effort needed to deliver the  entire product

scope creep-
-------------
un knowingly increasing the scope of a project or 
uncontrolled expansion of product or project scope without adjusting the time, cost, resources
scope creep requires you to do more work with same amount of time and money

why it will occur?
----------------
while writing sow and making a contract they wont clearly understand what they want and we also 
dont understand the requirements clearly

Gold plating : - means working on project even after the requirements have been met

principles
================
1)understand the root cause why are u doing the project,
2)for what u are doing it ...& 
3)how are they going to get benefitted, & you should understand the purpose of it
4)if your stake holder doesnt articulate what they want, then how can i best serve their needs
5) while starting a project u should understand project boundaries and scope  
else u may fell in scope creep & u may work for free and understand why are we doing this project and what is the end goal
5.1) u should know what is the scope & what is not there in the of scope? 
6)collaborate with stake holders and  ask questions from sow and ask what they want , be clear on project requirements
Dont become an unpaid consultant by doing the work that has not been agreed in advance(dont fell in project creep)u can acheive this by understanding the scope , requirements clearly
because stakeholders may forget what they have initially agreed upon
7) go with pro active apporach - u only introduce the requirements, u dont need to wait for customer

Real life scenario to understand the requirements clearly
--------------------
just hammer is useless right without nails, if u just buy hammer what is the use?
if u dont know what u will insert, then u may insert some bloody small nail,
after knowing the requirement at last if u have to insert a ac on it
again u have to remove old small nail and insert big nail 

problems u should avoid
=============
1) weak scope definition (so make sure your scope is clearly defined)
2) poorly defined sow
3) missing of defining what is not in scope- if u miss it later they will come back and say this was also in our scope 

weak scope definition
====================
when a product or service or end result is not mentioned in acceptance criteria 
and without knowing the requirements properly we cant estimate properly

poorly defined sow
===============
we should ensure sow should contain all the details and high level requirements, then they will come back and asks us to increase the work


project management foundations
====================================================================================
====================================================================================
create stakeholder register- who are all have the stake in ur project

two way communication:-
first focus on listening, always be mindful


writing emails:-----------------
1) use active voice insteadof passive voice
always use bullet points while writing in a mail

2) whie writing email to big persons- 1st write it and leave it for sometime and later come and polish

consider the audience....
who is the reader
what do they know
why is the reader interested

in first few lines itself write summary
3)in first few lines itself they should understand everything  

a good reader comunicates what the reader need to know
4) dont complicate the senetence--> write it in simple words- dont use words ending with ize-> prioritize,utilize these words makesmore complicate
5) write shorter bulet points
6) if possible add smileys, sketches,images, add colour ful charts
